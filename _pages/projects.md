The landscape of large language models (LLMs) is evolving rapidly, with a growing trend towards
training models on a combination of real and synthetic data. This synthetic data is often generated by previously trained models. However, the quality of these generators can significantly impact the performance of newly trained models, potentially leading to **model collapse** [(Shumailov et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17493), a phenomenon in which the model
drastically degrades in performance. 
While current theoretical studies primarily focus on label noise in synthetic data, they often overlook potential distribution shifts in the feature space between real and synthetic data. This gap is particularly relevant in practical scenarios where generative models are trained on finite real data sets, potentially leading to imperfect learning of the underlying distribution.
At the [Technology Innovation Institute](https://www.tii.ae/), together with **Dr. Mohamed El Amine Seddik**, we address this gap by proposing a statistical model that accounts for both distribution shifts in the feature space and label noise. In our model, we induce distribution shifts in the feature space by supposing that the statistics of synthetic data are empirical estimates of the underlying real data statistics. Our theoretical results are derived using **Random Matrix Theory.**

Machine learning methods are usually built upon low-dimensional intuitions which do not necessarily hold when processing high-dimensional data. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of the curse of dimensionality, by showing that high dimensions can alter the internal functioning of various ML methods designed with low-dimensional intuitions.
This project provides theoretical insights into high-dimensional binary classification with class-conditional noisy labels. Specifically, relying on **Random Matrix Theory**, we study the behavior of a linear classifier with a label noisiness aware loss function, when both the dimension of data p and the sample size n are large and comparable. Importantly, our findings show that the low-dimensional intuitions to handle label noise **do not hold** in high-dimension, in the sense that the optimal classifier in low-dimension dramatically fails in high-dimension. Based on our derivations, we design an optimized method that is shown to be provably more efficient in handling noisy labels in high dimensions.

## Composed Image Retrieval

Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR) has recently gained much attention by the computer vision community. It involves retrieving images based on a complex multi-type query comprised of a reference image and a text modification of this latter. CoIR is inherently challenging as it requires using advanced techniques to learn and integrate both visual and textual information. Many models have been created to solve this task, among which we find [BLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12086) and [BLIP-2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12597) models.

In this project, I investigated on the impact of the different embeddings produced by the BLIP model, which are the *query embedding* **q**, the *modification text* **t** and the *multimodal embedding* **f(q, t)**.

Worked under the supervision of Prof. **Pascal Bianchi** in the [LTCI](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/fr/recherche/labos/traitement-information-ltci) lab at TÃ©lÃ©com Paris on developing the theoretical part of the **Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)**, a recently discovered algorithm (since 2016) used for sampling from a wide variety of probability distributions. Unlike traditional methods, SVGD does not require restrictive conditions on the distribution to sample from.

This algorithm can be used in a wide variety of Machine Learning tasks such as **Reinforcement learning** and **Bayesian Machine Learning**. Additionally, sampling from a distribution is crucial in simulations across multiple domains:
- **Biology**: Simulating disease propagation in a population.
- **Finance**: Applying Monte Carlo methods for integral approximations.

In this project, I studied the convergence properties of SVGD, as well as porposed novel algorithms that enhance its performance. For instance, I proposed a **stochastic** version of SVGD (which I called **Stochastic SVGD**), as well as a mixture of SVGD and the well-known **Langevin** algorithm. My work is summarized in the two following reports: **state-of-the-art** and **final report.**

# Software engineering projects:

## Garden Connection Kit: Pact'AG
----

During our first year at TÃ©lÃ©com Paris, we created as a team of 6 members, a kit to connect a garden.

If you want to start growing your own fruits and vegetables, or any plant that you want, then you can use our product (this is just the purpose of the project, but we are not selling it actually !). 

The kit is comprised of a box that contains micro-controller that controls the actuators like lamps and pumps, and get the values of the different sensors like temperature, humidity and luminosity.

To manipulate the garden, like activating the pumps or just getting the temperature of the garden, we developed an android application that communicates with the micro-controller using a server. This server modifies a database and send the clientâ€™s orders to the micro-controller to execute them.

## Stereogame

As a team of 4, we created a game using OpenGL and the Python library pygame, which we called stereogame.

It is a two players game that looks like tennis but where you use a bat instead of a racket. And there are some special effects like explosive balls, or cloning the ball into 3, or teleportation, etc.

And what makes this game special is that it is suited for a 3D TV, and both players look at the same TV but from different angles, and when you change the angle you can see the camera of the other player. So using this technique, we can add as many players as we want in the game, and they will all see their own camera in full screen using on single TV. Hence, we donâ€™t need to split our screen to sub-screens !
