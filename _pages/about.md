Greetings! 
I am an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science master student at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/), specifically enrolled in the [Mathématiques, Vision et Apprentissage (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com) program. My coursework includes Deep Learning theory, Convex Optimization, Object Recognition and Computer Vision, Large Language Models, Graphs in Machine Learning and Random Matrix Theory. Prior to joining this program, I completed my Bachelor studies at the Grande École [Télécom paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) where I have taken several courses in Mathematics, Statistics, Economics as well as some Physics courses like Quantum Mechanics and Optics.
