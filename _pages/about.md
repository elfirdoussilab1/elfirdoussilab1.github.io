Greetings! 
I am an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science master student at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/), specifically enrolled in the [Mathématiques, Vision et Apprentissage (MVA)](https://www.master-mva.com) program. Prior to joining this program, I completed my Bachelor studies at the Grande École [Télécom paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) focusing on Mathematics and Computer Science. I am passionate about AI research and how we can use it to solve problems in other crucial fields like Medicine, Chemistry, Economics, etc. These interdisciplinary applications is, in my opinion, what makes AI more beneficial and appealing.
