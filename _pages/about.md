Greetings! 
I am an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science master student at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/), specifically enrolled in the MVA program. My coursework includes Deep Learning theory, Convex Optimization, Object Recognition and Computer Vision, Large Language Models, Graphs in Machine Learning and Random Matrix Theory. Prior to joining this program, I completed my Bachelor studies at the Grande École [Télécom paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) where I have taken several courses in Statistics, programming (Java, C++) as well as physics courses like Quantum Mechanics and Optical sciences.
